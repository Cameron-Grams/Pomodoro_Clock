I am trying to build a countdown timer that alternates between two session values, a main session
and a break session.  I have been storing the values in the DOM display through the 
count_down function.  The problem that I have not been able to solve is that at the end of
the session I can not get the timer to recognize a new current_time value to count down again;
the timer continues to hold the previous value and counts into the negative numbers instead
of recognizing the new value.

I have confirmed that the new value is updated to the DOM through console.log(current_time) 
and that new value time is recognized.  This new time is just not incorporated into the count by the 
timer. 

I have tried setting the timer obejct to null through counting=null and counting=false.  I
have tried the timer object's internal reset function and have tried to set a new timer
(in this last effort). I recognize that this is a scope problem since the timer is retaining
the countdown values from the initial start.  I read these postings that addressed scope;
[one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15995178/clearinterval-not-working), [two](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18957186/javascript-setinterval-clearinterval-simple-example-not-working-explained),
 [three](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/591269/settimeout-and-this-in-javascript), and 
decided on this [one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8126466/javascript-reset-setinterval-back-to-0)
 to try and keep all of the timing functions in a 
single timing object.

What is the best way to display a countdown from a timer and transition to a second timing 
interval on completion? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.
