Good afternoon.  I would appreciate feedback on this Pomodoro Clock.  I tried to use straight 
Javascript for the logic instead of JQuery and I would be interested in any observations of
where that was a good or bad decision, my motivation was to learn Javascript more thoroughly
before using the JQuery library.

Additionally I employed a timer object to try and control the scope issues with the timer
functions. Was that a good idea? Are there better options? 

Any insights, suggestions or observations are welcome.  Thank you for your time.
